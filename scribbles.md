# scribblez

where we are now: got parser structure in place, tidied up the lexer and moved things around a bit.
next: get all parser functions tested and the full parse of the test file working properly.

once that is done, we can start on combinations, and then on backends.
Let's do it!


----------------------------------------

Thoughts and stuff (been out ;-)

New name/concept: `vert`. **vert** is the name for the graphical engine / user interface we write, in zero, using zeta. It should have a backend for WebXR and for AVP.

So products are:

- zero: the programming language
- zeta: the compiler system
- one: the operating system
- vert: the interface

----

In general, there's a need to be able to display Lex and Parse outputs graphically, rooted in the actual text. By trying to cram as much text as we can onto the screen, we're avoiding the deeper question of how to minimise the amount of information we need to absorb. The power of a good visualisation engine for low-level data is incalculable. If it makes it easier for a human to understand (and all evidence suggests it does) then it should make it easier for a machine to understand, too.

So for instance, there's a general thing of "this region of the text connects to this random object" and we render text with that data structure in mind.

Today: got parser structure (parser functions output dict) working, with debug printouts so we can figure out where things go wrong. Feels nice man.

Also: got a really nice (if somewhat unelegant) lexer working now as well.
