# features

In which we explain the whole feature-modularity thing, again.

## what

The smallest shippable unit of code is the "feature" instead of "library" / "application".

## why, architectural

Associating code and data with features instead of objects makes a bunch of stuff easier and better and faster.

# why, engineering

The ability to analyse behaviour using features is a superpower when trying to reproduce, diagnose, and fix faults.

## why, economic

If you want to add a feature to a piece of commercial software, you can do so without creating a competing piece of commercial software.

## why, political

Users, not vendors, control which features they run. Less unmet needs, less dark patterns, more simplicity, more efficiency, and more joy.

## how

That's what we're trying to figure out.

## questions

So many questions.
