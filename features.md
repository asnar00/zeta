# features

In which we explain the whole feature-modularity thing, again.

## what

Code is organised into features instead of applications, libraries, and objects.

## why, architectural

It's just better.

## why, economic

Less replicated work.

## why, political

Users, not vendors, control which features they run.

## how

That's what we're trying to figure out.

## questions

I'm sure you can think of many.
