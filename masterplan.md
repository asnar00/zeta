# masterplan

ok so this is the current masterplan. look at it and master-debate it every morning before deciding whether to work or play.

- general
    - make sure code, social, studio, and travel all continue happen in balance
    - don't let get things too big or get too locked into anything
    - light touch

- plan is to make the zero computer.
NOW - zeta.ts: write the noob.org website
    - zerp: so people can try writing/learning zero code
    - self-hosting: zeta in zero
    - zerp.web: wasm/webgpu backend ðŸ‘€
    - build risc-v machine (portable, tiny)
    - zeta.rv: compile direct to risc-v 
    - eyeglasses, connectum.

and that's v1.
