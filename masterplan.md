# masterplan

ok so this is the current masterplan. look at it and master-debate it every morning before deciding whether to work or play.

driver projects:
0- zeta in zero
1- noob website
2- zerp : web-based literate IDE for zero
3- moop : drones for environmental cleanup

order of business:

1- zeta.py
2- zeta in zero
3- zeta.ts to create noob website
4- zeta.

We're *not* going to do MLIR. Too complex and too much legacy bullshit. Build feature-modular from scratch or go home.
